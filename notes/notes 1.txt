Agile: 
Pros
  1. project is divided into short and trasnparent iterations
  2. it has flexible changes process
  3. Quick release of the first product version
  4. The correctness of functional requirement is implmented into the development process
  5. Customer can see the result and understand whether they are satisfied with it or not
  
Cons
  1. the development team should be highly professional and client-oriented
  2. new requirement may be a conflict with the existing architecture 
  3. with further correction and change , there may be chances that the project will cross the expected time 
  4. there may be difficulty to estimate the final coast of the project due to constant iteration 
  5. a defined requirement is absent
